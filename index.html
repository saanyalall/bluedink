                <P class="small-text">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                    knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                    include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. Education frequently
                    takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves.
                    Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative
                    effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of
                    teaching is called pedagogy..</p>

                <P class="small-text">Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since
                    the printing press.Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to
                    choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.
                    Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and
                    traditional degrees and credentials.
                    The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus
                    universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the Open
                    University in the United Kingdom. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their
                    own form of certificate.</p>

                <P class="small-text">Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning
                    modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more
                    easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences. A consequence of the latter theory is that
                    effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning
                    modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective
                    for them.Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as Visual, Auditory
                    and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and
                    therefore restrict learning.Recent research has argued, "there is no adequate evidence base
                    to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice</p>
